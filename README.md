### Introduction to the Arduino Board

This is an outline of parts of the arduino board we generally come across:

![](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Reference/arduino_board.png)

Starting clockwise from the top center:

-   Analog Reference pin (orange)
-   Digital Ground (light green)
-   Digital Pins 2-13 (green)
-   Digital Pins 0-1/Serial In/Out - TX/RX (dark green) - _These pins cannot be used for digital i/o (**digitalRead** and **digitalWrite**) if you are also using serial communication (e.g. **Serial.begin**)_.
-   Reset Button - S1 (dark blue)
-   In-circuit Serial Programmer (blue-green)
-   Analog In Pins 0-5 (light blue)
-   Power and Ground Pins (power: orange, grounds: light orange)
-   External Power Supply In (9-12VDC) - X1 (pink)
-   Toggles External Power and USB Power (place jumper on two pins closest to desired supply) - SV1 (purple)
-   USB (used for uploading sketches to the board and for serial communication between the board and the computer; can be used to power the board) (yellow)


#### Digital Pins:

In addition to the specific functions listed below, the digital pins on an Arduino board can be used for general purpose input and output via the [pinMode()](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PinMode), [digitalRead()](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/DigitalRead), and [digitalWrite()](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/DigitalWrite) commands. Each pin has an internal pull-up resistor which can be turned on and off using digitalWrite() (w/ a value of HIGH or LOW, respectively) when the pin is configured as an input. The maximum current per pin is 40 mA.

-   **Serial: 0 (RX) and 1 (TX).** Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data.
- **External Interrupts: 2 and 3.** These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value.*
- **PWM: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11.** Provide 8-bit PWM output with the [analogWrite()](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogWrite) function. 
- **BT Reset: 7.** (Arduino BT-only) Connected to the reset line of the bluetooth module.
-  **SPI: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK).** These pins support SPI communication, which, although provided by the underlying hardware, is not currently included in the Arduino language.
-  **LED 13** There is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 13. When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it's off.

#### Analog Pins:

In addition to the specific functions listed below, the analog input pins support 10-bit analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) using the [analogRead()](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogRead) function. Most of the analog inputs can also be used as digital pins: analog input 0 as digital pin 14 through analog input 5 as digital pin 19. Analog inputs 6 and 7 (present on the Mini and BT) cannot be used as digital pins.

-   **I2C: 4 (SDA) and 5 (SCL).** Support I2C (TWI) communication using the [Wire library](http://wiring.org.co/reference/libraries/Wire/index.html)



### Breadboard
A breadboard is sometimes known as a solderless breadboard. It has lots of holes that you can stick wires or electronic components into, and which are connected inside the breadboard. This lets you create a circuit containing multiple components without having to physically attach them to each other.

#### Step 1: The Breadboard Connections
![Image result for breadboard connections](https://cdn.instructables.com/FTG/1AAH/F23XWM7G/FTG1AAHF23XWM7G.LARGE.gif?auto=webp&fit=bounds)
  
The top and bottom rows (the rows indicated by the blue) and are usually the (+) and (-) power supply holes and these move **horizontally** across the breadboard, while the holes for the components move **vertically** Each hole is connected to the many metal strips that are running underneath.  
  
Each wire forms a node. A node is a point in a circuit where two components are connected. Connections between different components are formed by putting their legs in a common node. On the bread board, a node is the row of holes that are connected by the strip of metal underneath.  
  
The long top and bottom row of holes are usually used for power supply connections.  

#### Step 2: Connecting the Components

 [![Picture of Connecting the Components](https://cdn.instructables.com/FZT/USFT/F2NOBNFA/FZTUSFTF2NOBNFA.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&fit=bounds)](https://cdn.instructables.com/FZT/USFT/F2NOBNFA/FZTUSFTF2NOBNFA.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&fit=bounds) 

The rest of the circuit is built by placing components and connecting them together with jumper wires. Then when a path is formed by wires and components from the positive supply node to the negative supply node, we can turn on the power and current flows through the path and the circuit comes alive.  
  
For chips with many legs (ICs), place them in the middle of the board so that half of the legs are on one side of the middle line and half are on the other side.  
  
A complete circuit might look like the one below.

#### Step 3: Building a Circuit on the Breadboard

 [![Picture of Building a Circuit on the Breadboard](https://cdn.instructables.com/FGT/UXY4/F2NOBNFR/FGTUXY4F2NOBNFR.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&fit=bounds)](https://cdn.instructables.com/FGT/UXY4/F2NOBNFR/FGTUXY4F2NOBNFR.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&fit=bounds) 

The circuit schematic, and the layout on the breadboard will turn out entirely different. Anyone using a breadboard must focus on the **connections** rather than their place on the schematic.  
  
When you use switches or potentiometers, you must use **single-core** plastic-coated wire of 0.6mm diameter (the standard size). Stranded wire is not suitable because it will crumple when pushed into a hole and it may damage the board if strands break off.  
  
The rest of the circuit is built by placing components and connecting them together with  
jumper wires. Then when a path is formed by wires and components from the positive  
supply node to the negative supply node, we can turn on the power and current flows  
through the path and the circuit comes alive.
